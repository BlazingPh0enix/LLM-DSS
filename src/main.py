The first law, the law of inertia, states that an object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. The second law quantitatively describes how the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration (F=ma), meaning a greater force is required to accelerate a heavier object. The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, explaining that forces always occur in pairs. Together, these laws provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the motion of everyday objects and are essential for fields ranging from engineering to celestial mechanics."},

Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. For instance, in a simple pendulum, potential energy at its highest point is converted into kinetic energy as it swings downwards, and back into potential energy as it rises. This principle applies across all scales, from subatomic particles to galactic clusters, and encompasses various forms of energy, including kinetic, potential, thermal, chemical, and nuclear. It is a powerful tool for analyzing physical systems, as it allows scientists and engineers to predict the behavior of a system without needing to know the intricate details of the processes involved."},

It is based on two postulates: first, that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion, and second, that the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their motion or the motion of the light source. These seemingly simple ideas lead to extraordinary consequences, including time dilation, where time passes more slowly for a moving observer, and length contraction, where objects appear shorter in their direction of motion. The theory also established the famous mass-energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E=mcÂ², demonstrating that mass and energy are interchangeable."},

This effect provided crucial evidence for the particle nature of light, as the classical wave theory could not explain its observed characteristics. Specifically, it was found that the emission of electrons depends on the light's frequency, not its intensity; below a certain threshold frequency, no electrons are emitted, no matter how bright the light. Albert Einstein explained this by proposing that light consists of discrete packets of energy called photons. The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, and an electron is only ejected if it absorbs a single photon with enough energy to overcome the material's binding force."},
